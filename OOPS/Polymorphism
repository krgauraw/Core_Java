Polymorphism:

1. Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. 
The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.

2. Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic. 
In Java, all Java objects are polymorphic since any object will pass the IS-A test for their own type and for the class Object.

3. Polymorphism is of two type:
	1. static binding or Compile time Polymorphism - Achieved through method overloading
	2. dynamic binding or Run time Polymorphism or Dynamic Method dispatch - Achieved through method overriding.
	
2. Runtime polymorphism: call to overridden method is decided at runtime.
